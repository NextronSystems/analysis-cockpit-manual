.. index:: Baselining Best Practices

Baselining
==========

This section assumes, that you have read the chapter
:ref:`basic-concepts/index:basic concepts`.

All incoming logs, that do not match an existing case, will show up in
the ``Baselining`` section. From here you can create cases and define
your baseline, meaning every event showing in the baseline is in theory
something unknown/new.
