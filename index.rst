Nextron Systems - Analysis Cockpit v4 
=====================================

Analysis Cockpit is the central platform for analyzing THOR
events and SIGMA matches generated by ASGARDs real time agents.

It can be used in an environment where scans results can be
automatically collected from ASGARD Management Centers or
environments in which THOR is executed by scripts or any other
3rd party solution.

In the following chapters we will describe how the Analysis Cockpit
works, how to install the system, and how to use it. Additional information
regarding troubleshooting, known issues, or general administrative tasks
can also be found.
