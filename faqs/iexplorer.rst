**Q: I am using Internet Explorer and the Analyst Cockpit seems to run into a timeout. What can I do?**

Modern browsers (e.g. Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Safari) support large URLs. Internet
Explorer does not. If you want to access the Analyst Cockpit and all its features,
you need to switch your browser.
