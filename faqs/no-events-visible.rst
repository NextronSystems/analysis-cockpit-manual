No Events visible

**Q: It seems that events are not visible or have been lost. What can I
do to verify that they're still in the database?**

If you think that some events are not visible or have been lost, you can
do the following to verify that they still exist in the database.

First, check your date range picker.

Very often, analysts forget to set it to the right time frame and old
events accidentally disappear from the view.

Secondly, make sure you're using the search in the ``Events`` section and
not the ``Baselining`` section.
