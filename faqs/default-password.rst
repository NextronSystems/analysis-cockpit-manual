Default password for file downloads
-----------------------------------

**Q: What is the password used to protect file downloads?**

Artifacts uploaded to a case might be malware. To ensure the file is not automatically deleted
by antivirus or executed by an unknowing user, we zip all files in the attachments and
encrypt the ZIP file with a default password. The default password ``infected`` can be 
used to extract the file.
