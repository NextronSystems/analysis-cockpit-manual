Hardware Requirements
---------------------

There are a few things to consider, before you start with the
installation.

If you install on VMWare, the minimum requirements for the virtual
machine are as follows:

* System memory: 16 GB
* Hard disk: 200 GB
* CPU cores: 2

The disk size of 200 GB is fine in scenarios where you import only
Alerts and Warnings into the Cockpit, scan less than 1.000 systems on a
weekly basis and want to keep the logs for less than one year. If you
also import Notices and Info messages for these 1.000 servers, we
recommend a disk size of at least 500 GB.

For an Installation of up to 20.000 endpoints the following
specifications are recommended:

* System memory: 32 GB
* Hard disk: 2 TB SSD
* CPU cores: 4
